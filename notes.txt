nested ternary operator
-----------------------
syntax:
(condition)? exp1:((condition)?exp2 :(condition)?exp3:exp4);
-------------------------------------------------------------

what are the diff between JVM, JRE, JDK
---------------------------------------
JVM - responsible for executing java byte code
      provides platform independence(wora).
      performs JIT(Just in time) compilation for faster execution
      Handles memory management and garbage collection
      memory area are like heap, stack, method area, pc registers, native method stacks.

JRE - JVM+libraries set
-----------------------
provides libraries, classes, and other files need to run java programs.

contains JVM+ core libraries.
doesn't include compilers or tools for development

JDK ==> JVM+JRE+ developer tools
--------------------------------
include everything in JRE, plus development tools
.java(compiler)
jar(archiver)
Javadoc (documentation generator)
used by developer to create and compile and debug java application.

if you only want to run a java application ==> JRE
you want to develop and run java programs  ==>JDK
if you want to explain or visualize execution ==JVM
